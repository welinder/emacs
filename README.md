This is my `.emacs.d/` configuration. It's **heavily** inspired by the nice organization of Greg Newman's [.emacs](http://github.com/gregnewman/20seven-emacs) and I couldn't resist stealing code from there too.

# Configuration Details #
## Emacs Release ##
I use the [GNU Emacs 23.1 for Mac OS X](http://emacsformacosx.com/). [Aquamacs](http://aquamacs.org/) is also nice, but the 2.0 beta kept on crashing. Maybe I'll switch in the future.

## Fonts ##
Based on the [tip from here](http://www.20seven.org/journal/2008/11/distraction-free-programming-with-gnu-emacs.html#comment-25058) I use [Inconsolata Medium](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Inconsolata).

## Color Theme ##
Use the [color-theme package](http://www.nongnu.org/color-theme/). 

## Fullscreen ##

For some reason the official 2009 summer release of Cocoa GNU Emacs 23.1 doesn't support fullscreen mode. However, there is a patch available (from typester) that fixes it. See instructions [here](http://www.stratospark.com/blog/2010/fullscreen_emacs_on_osx.html). Steve Purcell provides a [way to patch the latest version of Emacs](http://www.sanityinc.com/full-screen-support-for-cocoa-emacs-on-osx) with the full screen patch from typester.
